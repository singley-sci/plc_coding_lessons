## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Making a first epidemiologic plot

Let's set up the working environment in R by installing and loading some packages. 
Packages help us perform specialized functions in R without having to write tons of code.
Packages are a superpower of R that allow us to work efficiently. 
Anyone can write a package in R, but now, let's not focus on that, but rather on making a first plot in R right here. 

Because R might spit out some messages about these packages that we don't care about, we use the `message = FALSE` line to hide them. 

```{r loading packages, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
require(gapminder)
require(gganimate)
require(gifski)
require(av)
```

Now,  let's load a dataset called gapminder, and look at the data by performing a simple function to print the first several rows of data.
Anytime you see a word with an open parentheses in front of it `(` that means that this is a function.
The `head` function is printing us the first row of data down to the row number that we specify -- in this case `n = 15` (the first 15 rows of data)

```{r gapminder explore, echo = TRUE}
summary(gapminder)
head(gapminder, n = 15)
View()
```

```{r gapminder view, echo = TRUE}
View(gapminder)
```

Now, because there is so much data, let's examine a single year of it. How about 2007. 
```{r 2007 data, echo = TRUE}
data <- gapminder |>
  dplyr::filter(year == 2007)
head (data, n = 15)
```

OK, let's now make a scatter plot with income on the x-axis and life expectancy on the y-axis.
```{r plot data, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
plot2007 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
        geom_point(aes(size = pop, color = continent), alpha = 0.5) +
        stat_smooth(formula = y ~ log(x), 
                    se = FALSE, 
                    linewidth = 0.5, 
                    color = "black", 
                    method = 'gam', 
                    linetype = "dotted") +
        xlab("GDP per capita") +
        ylab("Life expectancy at birth") +
        scale_size_area(max_size = 15) +
        scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 50000), 
                           breaks = seq(0, 50000, by = 5000)) +
        ggtitle("Gapminder data from 2007") +
        labs(caption = "Data from dslabs library") +
        scale_color_brewer(name = "", palette = "Dark2") +
        theme_minimal(base_size = 12, base_family = "Georgia")
plot2007
```

### Write your interpretation of this plot on the following line(s)
(Make at least three observations about the plot). 
Blah Blah Blah.   




## Now, answer a few questions below...

### Question (1) 
The risk of acquiring a given disease during a time period is best determined by: 

A) the mortality rate from that disease in the 0–4 age group.
B) a spot map that records all cases of the disease in the past year.
C) the period prevalence for that disease during the past year.
D) the incidence rate (cumulative incidence) for that disease in a given period of time.

**Response: D**


### Questions (2) 
An epidemiologic survey of roller-skating injuries in Metroville, a city with a population of 100,000 (during the midpoint of the year), produced the following data for a particular year:

* Number of skaters in Metroville during any given month: 12,000.   
* Roller-skating injuries in Metroville: 600.   
* Total number of residents injured from roller-skating: 1800.   
* Total number of deaths from roller-skating: 90.   
* Total number of deaths from all causes: 900.   

The crude death rate for all causes was:

A) 90/600 × 100,000.    
B) 900/100,000 × 100,000.    
C) 90/1,800 × 100,000.    
D) 90/900 × 100,000.    

**Response: ** 


### Question (3)
An epidemiologic survey of roller-skating injuries in Metroville, a city with a population of 100,000 (during the midpoint of the year), produced the following data for a particular year:

* Number of skaters in Metroville during any given month: 12,000.   
* Roller-skating injuries in Metroville: 600.   
* Total number of residents injured from roller-skating: 1800.   
* Total number of deaths from roller-skating: 90.   
* Total number of deaths from all causes: 900.  

The cause-specific mortality rate from roller-skating was: 

A) 90/600 × 100,000. 
B) 90/100,000 × 100,000. 
C) 90/1800 × 100,000. 
D) 90/900 × 100,000. 

**Response: **


### Question (4) 
An epidemiologic survey of roller-skating injuries in Metroville, a city with a population of 100,000 (during the midpoint of the year), produced the following data for a particular year:

* Number of skaters in Metroville during any given month: 12,000.   
* Roller-skating injuries in Metroville: 600.   
* Total number of residents injured from roller-skating: 1800.   
* Total number of deaths from roller-skating: 90.   
* Total number of deaths from all causes: 900.  

The proportional mortality ratio (%) due to roller-skating was: 

A) 90/600 × 100. 
B) 90/100,000 × 100. 
C) 90/1800 × 100. 
D) 90/900 × 100. 

**Response: **


### Question (5)
Expressing the burden or extent of some condition or attribute in a population:

A) uses primarily incidence data. 
B) uses primarily prevalence data. 
C) could use both incidence and prevalence data equally. 
D) uses neither incidence data nor prevalence data. 

**Response: **


### Question (6)
Successful treatment programs that would shorten the duration of a disease primarily affect: 

A) the prevalence of the disease. 
B) the incidence of the disease. 
C) both the incidence and the prevalence of the disease. 
D) neither the incidence nor the prevalence of the disease. 

**Response: **


### Question (7)
The incidence of a disease is five times greater in men than in women, but the prevalence shows no sex difference. The most likely explanation is that: 

A) the mortality rate is greater in women.
B) the case fatality rate is greater in women.
C) the duration of the disease is greater in women.
D) women receive less adequate medical care for the disease.

**Response: **


### Question (8)
How many people would be needed to accumulate 900 person-years of observation if the average time at risk per person was 10 years? 

**Response: **
