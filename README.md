# Activity Library for Coding Across Courses

## Overview
This library provides a collection of short, single-session activities that integrate computer coding (mostly in R) into disciplinary courses. These activities are designed to help students engage with data in meaningful ways that support course-specific topical learning outcomes while building familiarity and confidence in coding. The materials include hands-on exercises, datasets, and guided instruction to facilitate learning across various disciplines. 

## Context for Use
The provided activities are intended for us in undergraduate courses across disciplines where data analysis and visualizations can enhance learning. They are designed to:
- Support students with minimal or no prior coding experience
- Provide scaffolded exercises to build confidence and fluency in the chosen programming language.
- Reinforce data literacy within disciplinary contexts
- Offer flexbility in implementation, whether used as in-class exercises, homework, or lab activities.

In general, these activities are provided as exmaples than can be used to build your own similar lessons to meet the needs of your specific course. We encourage users to treat them as a set of templates, even if the exact topics or datasets don't align with what you teach.
